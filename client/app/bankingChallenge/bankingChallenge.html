        <p>This challenge is to see how well you're able to apply what you've learned about JavaScript.</p>

        <p>
          During your technical interview, we will review your banking challenge code and ask you to iterate through an additional problem set. Before the interview, put your completed code on gist.
        </p>

        <p>Create a file called banking.js</p>

        <p>You'll be creating 2 classes in this file. The two classes interact with each other. You'll make the Person class and the Bank class.</p>

        <h3>Person Class</h3>

        <p>A new person should have a name set and should have a certain amount of cash that the person keeps with him/her.</p>

        <h3>Bank class</h3>

        <p>With the bank, you should be able to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>open a new account using the person's name</li>
          <li>withdraw money from a person's account</li>
          <li>deposit money into a person's account</li>
          <li>transfer money to another bank</li>
        </ul>
